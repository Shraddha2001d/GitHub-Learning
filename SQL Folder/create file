# üìù My GitHub Learning Notes

Date: 15 August 2025

### Today, I practiced:

- Creating a folder in my repository (SQL folder)
- Uploading my first file to GitHub
- Writing a README file for my folder

### Things I learned:

- To make a folder directly on GitHub, type foldername/filename while creating a new file
- Always write a short, clear commit message
- README files make your repo easier to understand
- We can't open Excel files (.xlsx, .xls) and word files(.docx) on GitHub.
  GitHub will only show the file name and a download option.
